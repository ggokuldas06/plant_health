Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two CSV files:

1. leafcare_dataset.csv

This file contains the metadata and labels for each image used in training, validation, and testing.

Column Name	      Description
image_id	        Unique identifier for each image sample
image_path	      Relative or absolute path to the image file
disease_present	  Binary label indicating presence of disease: 0 (Healthy) or 1 (Diseased)
  
severity	Severity label: danger, mild, not_severe, or none
split	Dataset partition: train, val, or test

Example Entry:

image_id: LC0001
image_path: images/train/img_0001.jpg
disease_present: 1
severity: mild
split: train

File Path: /mnt/data/leafcare_sample/leafcare_dataset.csv

2. leafcare_guidance_templates.csv

This file defines short, safe care suggestions for each possible prediction outcome, ensuring non-toxic, actionable, and easily understandable guidance.

Key	Message
no_disease	No disease signs detected by the model. Keep regular care: adequate watering, good light, and monitor leaves for changes.
danger_high	Possible severe disease. Isolate the plant to prevent spread, remove heavily damaged leaves, ensure good airflow, and consider a targeted fungicide per local guidance.
danger_low	Possible severe disease but low confidence. Recheck with a clearer photo, isolate the plant, and seek expert advice.
mild_high	Mild disease signs. Trim affected spots, avoid overhead watering, and improve light/airflow.
mild_low	Mild signs (low confidence). Monitor for 3–5 days, keep leaves dry, and ensure consistent watering (not soggy).
not_severe_high	Not severe. Remove a few damaged leaves, water regularly, and check for pests.
not_severe_low	Minor changes detected with low confidence. Retake a photo in good light and monitor.

🔎 Data Usage

The dataset is designed to train a multi-task CNN model that outputs:

Disease presence probability.

Severity classification among three levels.

The model predictions are then linked to the guidance templates for interpretability and user advice.

📊 Dataset Statistics (Sample Version)

Training samples: 80

Validation samples: 20

Test samples: 20

Total samples: 120

Classes: 4 (none, not_severe, mild, danger)

🕵️ Notes

Image paths are placeholders; replace them with actual dataset images before model training.

Ensure class balance using resampling or weighted losses.

The dataset supports explainable AI workflows (e.g., Grad-CAM visualization).

Disclaimer: The dataset is for educational and research purposes only. All care recommendations should be reviewed by agricultural experts before field deployment.\
